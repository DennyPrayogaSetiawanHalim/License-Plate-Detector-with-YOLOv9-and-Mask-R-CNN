# License-Plate-Detector-with-YOLOv9-and-Mask-R-CNN
Both YOLOv9 and Mask R-CNN were used in order to be compared in License Plate Detection

Dataset used : https://universe.roboflow.com/denny-pmzkg/plat-nomor-kendaraan-wxalb (568 images of Indonesian License Plates)
<br/>

-API key in PyNotebook is probably outdated since i changed the roboflow project 
<br/>
-Also you might want to change file names accordingly

# Summary
Both Models are trained using the dataset with 70% of them (398 images) used as training dataset, 20% (114 images) as validation dataset, and the rest 10% (56 images) as test dataset.
Models can also be used on a single image/video and using EasyOCR to detect characters found in the license plate.
